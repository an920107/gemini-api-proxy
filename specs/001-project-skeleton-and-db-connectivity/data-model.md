# Data Model: Project Skeleton & Database Connectivity

## Overview

This feature is focused on setting up the project structure and verifying database connectivity. As such, it does not introduce any new, persistent data models.

## Entities

No entities are defined in this feature. A simple, temporary table may be created during the database migration setup to verify the process, but it is not considered part of the core data model.
